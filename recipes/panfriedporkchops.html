    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
        <p>Pan fried pork chops are another favorite staple of mine. Very little seasoning is needed, as the pork chops themselves have so much flavor. Personally, I'm a fan of serving them with roasted sweet potatoes to balance the flavors.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the cayenne pepper compliments the meat very well. Adjust the amount of cayenne based on your personal preference. Pork chops dry out very easily and very fast. Be sure to monitor them closely as they will cook within a couple minutes.</p>
        <p>This recipe calls for boneless porkchops, but bone in pork chops will be even better, since the bone keeps the meat moist and imparts flavor. Cooking times will vary depending on the thickness, and the type of pork chop you use.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>6-8 pieces of thinly sliced pork chops, boneless</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, adjust based on desired spicyness level</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat dry pork chops, salt and pepper both sides and set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine flour and cayenne pepper. Dredge both sides of pork chops in flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat oil over medium high heat. Add pork chops to pan, 2-3 minutes on one side, and 1-2 minutes on the other side.</li>
            <li>Monitor doneness of porkchops. Make sure no pink juices remain. Serve immediately with sides of your choice.</li>
