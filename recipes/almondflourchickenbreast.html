    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>

        <p>Chicken breast recipes have always alluded me. Chicken breast tends to dry out very easily, and will usually taste bland without some sort of panko breading or marinade. Breading the meat with seasoned almond flour has been a "hack" for a healthier, low carb, gluten free alternative to traditional panko breading.</p>
        <p>This is another very quick recipe where the only preparation involves butterflying/flattening breasts. Here, we will be roasting the breasts, however, feel free to pan fry them in a skillet with some oil!</p>
        <p>Almond flour does not adhere to the breast as well as breadcrumbs, so try keeping one hand dry to sprinkle flour, and the other hand to handle the breast itself during the breading steps. Also be sure to let excess egg drip off the breasts before breading, as this will help with the crispiness of the chicken.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately the cooked breasts do not stay that crispy if reheated in a microwave, rather than an oven </p>
        <p>Allergies Warning: contains nuts/almonds</p>
