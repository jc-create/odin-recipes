    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>

    <p>Chicken breast recipes have always alluded me. They dry out very easily, and always taste bland without some sort of panko breading or marinade. Breading the meat with seasoned almond flour has been a "hack" for a healthier, low carb, gluten free alternative to traditional panko breading.</p>
    <p>This is another very quick recipe where the only preparation involves butterflying/flattening breasts. Here, we will be roasting the breasts, however, feel free to pan fry them in a skillet with some oil!</p>
